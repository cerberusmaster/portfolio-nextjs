When we are at the beginning, we don't have any experience and even exact plan how to build AR based gambling apps. We did research, brainstorm, consult with experts, learn from communities, at last we built our products based on our very own infrastructure. I'm excited to share things that I've achieved in GOC.

## About 

[GOC](https://gameonthechain.com/) provides AR based live casino game running in virtual studio

## AR based live streaming

Implemented webrtc and reduced latency less than 1~2 seconds. Optimized streaming and proper resolution.
Generate Aximmetry (manipulate green screen with Unreal Engine), Environments, level management, etc.
Building plugins with C++ and Blueprint interacts with back-end APIs and GOC machines.

## Web App

I've built [web app](https://roulette-frontend.onrender.com/) based on Reactjs, context, hook, react toolkit, react query, and mobx.
Implemented user management with firebase authentication, live streaming with FlowPlayer. API Integration with react query.
