## About

[Virtual Home Designer](https://web-gl-threejs-virtual-designer.vercel.app/) was kind of assitant application that helps people to design their home with digital assets, comes from furniture products. People were able to choose several styles of elements in a room - including floors, room styles (modern, classic, nature, industrial for example), and furnitures their products ( sofas, armchari, charis, fllor lamps, carpets, coffee tables, dinning tables etc)

Literally provides more specified features and functions let people do design more details and customizable.

After that they're Looking around inner rooms, moving furnitures, spawn furnitures, clone furnitures, chaing styles, colors sizes, rotation of each furnitures what they prefer.
All of furnitures are built from 3d modelers and graphic designers.

These features are implemented in front-end side using webgl, in this case, i used React Three fibre.

On the back-end, there were Unreal Engine app is running on AWS EC2, which are interacting & communicating with webapp via AWS Websocket API.

Unreal Engine provides realistic rendering you know, with lights, environments, particles, materials, shadows etc. This helps people to get more exact and realistic visualization what they designed.
Once people confirm their design plan, all information/data automatically sent to Unreal Engine and it replies with rendered images.

## AWS Lambda functions

- Turn on/off unreal engine - so running only CET time zone
- Websocket receive render request from webapp
- Managing render tasks within queue
- Trigger renering to unreal engine, store renered images to s3 bucket and reply urls to webapp.
- API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3 bucket to store digital assets

## Web App

Following React best practices, I built **redux store**, **contexts**, **routers** and **navigations**, **components** and **pages**.
At last in designning pages (expert and simple mode), All operations were builtin **React Three Fibre**.
    
**Movement of camera** to look around, **movement of furnitures** to change positions and rotation, added **animations for each actions**, I like to add animations always, bc it makes the app alive and good looking

Managed **user interaction** detect mouse events to select objects and move them flexibly.
**C*hallenge*** was perfecting user operations, there were many reasons of mouse interaction, rotating cameras, select objects to rotation or move, also there were html UI components. It often crashes and hard to determine which purpose of actions

I studied event processing deeply and updated algorithm to manage it.

## Unreal Engine

I worked on C++, Blueprint, all 3D assets are provided from design team.
There were many transforming operations including spawning furniture, cloning furniture, hide and show furnitures, rotating, resize, move products etc
One challenge was optimizing rendering tasks, sometimes it's exceeded over 50.
I had to create several levels and rendered in parallel.
